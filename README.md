# portswigger-academy-writeups
These are my personal and intentionally a bit dumb writeups in breaking portswigger academy labs, a free online training center for web application security.

This is how I track my progress in learning web application penetration testing 

# structure
I organize writeups by *vulnerability* rather than difficulty, so it's easy to see examples of OWASP Top 10 issues and common security risks.

# how I write the challenge
- vulnerability (challenge name)
- steps to reproduce
- explanation to why it happened or how to fix
